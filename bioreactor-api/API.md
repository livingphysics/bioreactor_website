# Bioreactor API Reference

Base URL: `https://issued-fantasy-fighter-specials.trycloudflare.com`

All endpoints require authentication:
```
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
```

## System

### Health Check
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" https://<host>/health
```

### List Capabilities
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" https://<host>/api/capabilities
```

### Aggregate State (for the live monitor)
One call returns bath temp, ambient temp, signed peltier current, peltier
duty/direction, and heater-run status — poll this at ~1 Hz instead of hitting
each sensor endpoint separately.
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" https://<host>/api/state
```
Response: `{"status": "success", "temperature": 24.2, "ambient_temp": 24.4, "peltier_current": 0.02, "peltier": {"duty_cycle": 0, "direction": "cool", "active": false}, "heater": {...}}`

## Heater Control (schedule / PID)

The control loop runs on the Pi with safety cutoffs (peltier off if the bath
temperature reads NaN for 15 samples or leaves the 2–60 °C window). While a run
is active, manual `POST /api/peltier_driver/control` returns `409`.

**Upload + run a schedule** (CSV body, `duty,direction,hold_s`, same format as heater_gui):
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: text/csv" \
  --data-binary $'duty,direction,hold_s\n50,cool,120\n0,heat,30\n70,heat,60\n' \
  https://<host>/api/heater/schedule
```

**Run a PID setpoint:**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"setpoint": 37.0, "kp": 12.0, "ki": 0.015, "kd": 0.0}' \
  https://<host>/api/heater/pid
```

**Status of the current run:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" https://<host>/api/heater/status
```
Response: `{"active": true, "mode": "schedule", "step": 2, "total_steps": 3, "last": {"temperature": 24.2, "ambient_temp": 24.4, "peltier_current": -0.36, ...}, ...}`

**Stop any active run (peltier off):**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" https://<host>/api/heater/stop
```
